A chess board is a 8x8 grid so the positions of the queens can be notated as:
QR(n) (the row of queen number n)
QC(n) (the column of queen number n)

For every two queens there are the following rules:
They cannot be on the same row
They cannot be on the same column
They cannot be on the same diagonal

For the row and column it is simmple - QR and QC must be different.

The diagonals have two directions - top to bottom (*1) and bottom to top (*2).

1)
In order for two queens to be in the same diagonal they need to have the same ratio of row to column.
But if we look at the grid as a plane and the rows as the x-axis and the columns as the y-axis, we see that 
all points on a line represented by `y = x + n` lie on a diagonal. To check if they lie on such a line, we can simply 
compare the differences of the x and y coordinates respectively. 

ex: Q1 (3,4); Q2 (7,8); Q3 (1,6)
The difference of the rows between Q1 and Q2 is 4 and so is the difference betweeen the columns, therefore it lies on `y = x + 4`
and therefore the two queens lie on the same diagonal.
Q1 - Q3 produces x: 2 and y: -2 which is not the `y = x + n` and therefore doesn't lien on a diagonal

2)
In order for two queens to be in the same diagonal they need to be equally away from the begining point (0,0).
Since we are working with numbers in the range of [1, 8] there is no need for the usual formula and instead 
can be used something way simpler - the sum of the x and y of each queen.

ex: Q1 (3,4); Q2 (7,8); Q3 (1,6)
Q1x + Q1y = 7
Q2x + Q2y = 15
Q3x + Q3y = 7

As you can see the distance between (0,0) and Q1 and between (0,0) and Q3 is the same, therefore they lie on the same diagonal.
Q2 is further away and is therefore not on the same diagonal as the other two.
