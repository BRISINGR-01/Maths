# Stability Control of a Ferromagnetic Pendulum via Electromagnetic Actuation

This is a theoretical design of an inverted pendulum ending in a metal ball, controlled by a magnet hanging above. There are Simulink simulations and a ThreeJS one.

## Running ThreeJS

Visit [https://systems-control.vercel.app/](https://systems-control.vercel.app/) or  
```bash
cd "3d animation"
npm i
npm run dev
```
