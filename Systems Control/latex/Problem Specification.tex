\section{Problem Specification}

This section describes the physical system and the control problem addressed in this project. Initially, the dynamics of the inverted pendulum and the electromagnetic actuation mechanism are introduced in order to define the underlying system physical behavior. Based on that, a mathematical model of the system is proposed and linearized around the upright equilibrium point to obtain a representation suitable for controller design.

The purpose of this section is to define the problem to be solved, including the system states, inputs, outputs, and stability properties. This provides the essential basis for the controller design and further analysis.
