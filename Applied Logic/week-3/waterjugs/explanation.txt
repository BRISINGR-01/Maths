The solution aims to depict the steps taken between the first (8 0 0) and the last (4 4 0) pouring.
That's why those are set as constrains of the step's flow.

Every step is defined by the jar and the round and contains the amount of water contained in that jar
during the round. 

The values are always between 0 and the maximum of each jar. The sum of the water of 
the jars should always be equal to 8 since no water is neither gained nor lost.

Since at every step the water fomr one jar is pored into another, there is always one jar whose contents
remain the same and therefore we can say that for every time a jar stays the same, one of the other two
gets emptied or filled.
