Usually dices have six sides with the numbers from 1 to six, but the dices from this problem can have repeating
values. In one of the examples on wikipedia it can even contain 0.

The problem states that:
`for each die in the set, there is another die that rolls a higher number than it more than half the time.`

This can be easiestly represented cyclically: A > B, B > C,..., (last dice) > A
In order for a dice to have a bigger number more than half of the time, this has to happen more times that the half
of the amount of sides (3). So for every pair of sides of two consequetive dices (ex: B and C) there have to be at 
four sides from the first dice that are bigger than the respective side on other dice.
