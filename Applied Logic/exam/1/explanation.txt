All the numbers on the inner wheel must have an equal counterpart on the outer wheel, since in every rotation
at least one number is the same. Therefore the numbers on the inner wheel must be different integers between 1 and 5.

At least on side should have equal numbers =>
n => 1
Where `n` is the amount of the coincedenting numbers.

This has to be applied for every possible rotation. Since there are 5 sides, the wheel can be rotated 5 times.

Each rotaion can be represented as the sequence of numbers starting from the number after the previous starting 
point before the rotation.
ex: `1 2 3 4 5` is the initial state. After rotaion it would be `2 3 4 5 1`, then `3 4 5 1 2`, and so on until the
initial state is achieved.
