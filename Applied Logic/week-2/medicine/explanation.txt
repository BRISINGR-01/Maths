Every medicine has a number and is either tested or not every round.
Therefore for every  number per test round there is a boolean saying if the medicine has been tested M(num round) -> hasBeenTested


1) For every round from 1 to 10 there must be 3 tests.
2) Every Medicine must be tested 5 times.

For the first two rules there is simply an iteration through all medicines or all rounds and taking the sum of the tests run for 
all instances and comparing that to 3 or 5 respectively. 
 
3) Pairs of medicine
This rule ca be interpreted as follows:
The sum of the combinations of medicines that have been tested together must be 2
