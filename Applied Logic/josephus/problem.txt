We play the following one-person game: We have arranged 40 people in a circle. 
The people are numbered from 1 to 40, and they are arranged in that order 
(hence person 40 is between person 39 and person 1).

At the start we give a flag to person 1. Then they perform the following process: 1 tells 2 to leave the circle 
and hands over the flag to 3, who tells 4 to leave and hands over the flag to 5, etc. When the circle is completed,
this process continues, skipping the people who have already left (we assume all people obey the request to leave
when it’s given to them). That is: everyone with the flag asks ‘the next one that’s still left over’ to leave and
then hands over the flag to ‘the next one after that’. This process continues until there’s only one person
left over.

Let Z3 determine (the number of) that last person.
