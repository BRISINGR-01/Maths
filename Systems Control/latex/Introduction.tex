\section{Introduction}
This project describes the control system of an inverted pendulum ending in a metal ball with a controlled magnet hanging above the pendulum. In this document, we shall describe, develop and compare two popular strategies for controlling a closed-loop system. Furthermore, we shall describe the physics behind the system and implement animations displaying the controllers in action.
