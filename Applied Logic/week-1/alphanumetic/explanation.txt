1) All letters are declared as seperate variables
2) The rules are applied as follows:
  - The first letter of a word cannot be a 0 since it is the first digit of a number
  - The letters contain a value between 0 and 9 (or 1 to 9 as we know from 1)*)
  - all letters must have a distinct value

3) The puzzle is basically an equation of adding a few numbers and getting another. 
Therefore if we add together all the letters of the added words with account of their decimal position,
that should equal the sum of the letters of the result.
ex: AS + A = MOM => 10 * A + S + A = 100 * M + 10 * O + M
