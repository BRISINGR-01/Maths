The problem has two main conditions:
1) The graph should not have: 3 vertices, each pair of which are mutually connected by an edge.
2) The graph should not have: 3 vertices, no pair of which are mutually connected by an edge.

Since in logic the negation of 
`exists f` or !(Ex: allowed values: assertion) is 
`all !f` or (Ax: same values: negated assertion) and vice-versa,
the conditions declared in the problem can be transformed into:

1) For every 3 vertices in the graph at least one pair is not an edge
2) For every 3 vertices in the graph at least one pair is an edge

The following grpahs satisfy the conditions: (all are produced from `solution.smt`)
