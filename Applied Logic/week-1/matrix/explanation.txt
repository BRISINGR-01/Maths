a)
A 2x2 matrix and its inverse contain 9 elements in total:
  the elements of the matrix - A, B, C, D
  the elements of the inverse - IA, IB, IC, ID
  and the descriminant - DI

The formula for the descriminant is: DI = A*D - B*C

 It is needed to find the inverse. The formula for the inverse is the following:

  IA = D / DI
  IB = -B / DI
  IC = -C / DI
  ID = A / DI

Therefore if DI is 0 an inverse doesn't exist, since it is not possible to divide by 0.

b)
The same rules apply, but the elements of the inverse matrix must be in the following range: [-9, 9]
