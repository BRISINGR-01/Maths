\section{Setup}

In this section, the technology stack specification is provided for this project. First of all, this document was created and developed in Overleaf. This online tool facilitates the creation of formulas and a document outline, which significantly reduces the time required for report editing.

For implementing and testing the developed system model, MATLAB was used. Furthermore, we are using Simulink to build block diagrams for the system's iterations and controllers. Based on these simulations, we create interactive animations for both controllers in 2D using MATLAB's built-in graphics drawing features. Furthermore, a 3D interactive playground for the LQR control mechanism was created using Three JS and Typescript. The playground could be accessed via \href{https://systems-control.vercel.app/}{https://systems-control.vercel.app/}.

Project report, MATLAB scripts, Simulink models and animations are shared on Github repositories of the authors:
